This repository contains a collection of Python codes for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter datasets.

Getting Started
To use these codes, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip install.

Usage
To use these codes, you will need to provide a Twitter dataset in the form of a CSV file. The dataset should contain at least two columns: one for the tweet text, and one for the label (either positive, negative, or neutral).

Once you have your dataset ready, you can run the sentiment analysis by following these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal.
Run the script sentiment_analysis.py by typing python sentiment_analysis.py path/to/your/dataset.csv.
The script will output a series of plots and metrics showing the sentiment of the tweets in your dataset.

Notes
The sentiment analysis is performed using a combination of machine learning algorithms and word embeddings.
The codes in this repository are intended for educational and research purposes only, and are not intended for commercial use.
I hope these codes are helpful for your sentiment analysis tasks! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
